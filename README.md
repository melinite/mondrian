Mondrian is a smart and easy-to-learn vector graphics web app.

Try it at [mondrian.io](http://mondrian.io).

## Features

#### Basic

Mondrian offers all the tools needed to create, modify, and export simple SVG files.

  - Basic editing capabilities
    - Strict drawing with the pen tool
    - Loose drawing with the crayon tool
    - Shape manipulation (scaling & rotation)
    - Individual point manipulation with bezier controls
    - Basic typography
    - Zoom, eyedropper
    - Smooth, efficient tools & operations
  - File import (via `FileReader`)
    - SVG
  - File export
    - SVG
    - PNG (via `canvas` API)
  - Clean UI
    - Minimal "flat" aesthetic with little visual distraction
    - A smart UI that shows only utilities that can be used at that moment
  - Layout
    - Basic dot grid with snapping for layout

#### Innovations

Mondrian also supports undo/redo through a *(somewhat rough and unstable)* file history API that

  - stores operations, not states
  - is tiny and JSON-serializable, so it can be persisted to a server and loaded back up in another session
  - can visually reconstruct a file's entire history step-by-step

There are no tests written for this system. It's a big todo.

## Running the app

Mondrian is a simple static site.

To run it locally for the first time you have to clone the repo,
install the dependencies, and build the source files.

```
git clone git@github.com:artursapek/mondrian.git
cd mondrian
npm install
cake build
cake server
```

Then, open [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser, and there you have it!

You can also access the latest stable build at [mondrian.io](http://mondrian.io).

#### Installing Dependencies

`npm install`

#### Running the local server

`cake server`

#### Building the app

Run the build task to compile all of the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS from `/src/` into `/build/`.

`cake build`

It features a dumb progress bar that's based off the last compile time. It's actually pretty accurate.

```
> cake build
[██████         ] 14 seconds remaining
```

The entire app is written in [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/). You have
to manually compile the app every time you make changes.

The source files are specified in an ordered map in [`build.yml`](build.yml).
They are nested under their directory names. You can specify a different
directory name using the `_dir:` key. `null` means no directory.

For example,

```yml
src: !!omap
  - setup:
    - _dir: null
    - settings
    - setup
  - userInterface:
    - _dir: ui
    - selection
  - geometry:
    - posn
    - line-segment
```

refers to

```
src/settings.coffee
src/setup.coffee
src/ui/selection.coffee
src/geometry/posn.coffee
src/geometry/line-segment.coffee
```
