          Today I'm open-sourcing it.

            Why?
          I want to make something simpler, smarter, and more accessible than what's available. 
          I think a lot of people want software like this, and I think there are developers who want to work on it.

          I've spent the last year building Mondrian in private. It's at a pretty solid level of usability. 
          It has been the most fun and interesting thing I have ever worked on, but I'm getting frustrated 
          with the slow rate of progress I can muster by myself on weekends.

            Come Help Build It
          I'm calling those who love math, geometry, art, and the web. A group of us could 
          make Mondrian really amazing. Email me directly or just fork the repo and open a pull request at 
          %a{ href: "http://github.com/artursapek/mondrian" }

          I'd love to meet you if you live in New York and are interested in getting involved. Please get in touch.
